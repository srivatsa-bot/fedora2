12) touch pad scrolling issue
   ```
To half your current touchpad scroll speed with a keypad size of 130mm x 80mm, you'll want to halve these dimensions. Hereâ€™s how to do it step by step:

### Steps to Halve the Scroll Speed:

1. **Calculate New Dimensions:**
   - Half of 130mm is 65mm.
   - Half of 80mm is 40mm.
   - So, your new dimensions will be 65mm x 40mm.

2. **Install `libinput-tools` (if not already installed):**
   - On Fedora, install the package with:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install libinput-utils
     ```

3. **Run the Measurement Command:**
   - Use the following command to adjust the scroll speed:
     ```bash
     sudo libinput measure touchpad-size 65x40
     ```

4. **Test the Configuration:**
   - After running the command, move your fingers around the touchpad to check the functionality. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the measurement once you're satisfied.

5. **Copy the Configuration Text:**
   - The terminal will display some configuration text. Copy the text found between the markers (usually `-8<------`).

6. **Create a Configuration File:**
   - As root, create a new file to store the custom configuration:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/udev/hwdb.d/61-evdev-local.hwdb
     ```
   - Paste the copied configuration text into this file, then save and close the editor (use `Ctrl + O` to save and `Ctrl + X` to exit in nano).

7. **Update the Hardware Database:**
   - Apply the new configuration by updating the hardware database:
     ```bash
     sudo systemd-hwdb update
     ```

8. **Trigger the Changes:**
   - Reload the device configuration with:
     ```bash
     sudo udevadm trigger /dev/input/event*
     ```

9. **Reboot the System:**
   - Reboot your system to apply the changes:
     ```bash
     sudo reboot
     ```

### Final Steps:
- After rebooting, the scroll speed should be slower. If the cursor speed has also changed, you can adjust it in your system settings to your preference.

If you find that the scroll speed is still not ideal, you can repeat the process and further adjust the dimensions as needed.

my touch pad size is 130 X 80mm. i want to decrease the scrool speed by 60% so my value are 65 X 40. turn on touchpad accelaration in tweaks for better experience.

14) to enable pinch to zoom in edge

   ```
To navigate to the directory `~/.var/app/com.microsoft.Edge/config/` in Fedora, you can follow these steps:

1. **Open the Terminal**:
   - You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T` or searching for "Terminal" in your applications menu.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   - Use the `cd` (change directory) command to go to the specified path. Enter the following command:
     ```bash
     cd ~/.var/app/com.microsoft.Edge/config/
     ```

3. **Create or Edit the Configuration File**:
   - If the `edge-flags.conf` file doesn't exist, you can create it using a text editor like `nano` or `vim`. For example, to create or edit the file with `nano`, use:
     ```bash
     nano edge-flags.conf
     ```
   - Add your custom flags, each on a new line. For example:
     ```plaintext
     --ozone-platform=wayland
     --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform
     ```

4. **Save and Exit**:
   - If you're using `nano`, save the file by pressing `Ctrl + O`, then press `Enter`, and exit by pressing `Ctrl + X`.

This should help you set up the custom flags for Microsoft Edge on your Fedora system. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š

***FOR CODING***
1) dont need to install python comes by default
2) to insatll c/cpp - `sudo dnf install gcc-c++ -y`. to verify do `gcc --version` in terminal
3) java comes pre installed too, you need to set java path manually.
4) install node - `sudo dnf install nodejs`. verify `node --version` `npm --version`
5)
